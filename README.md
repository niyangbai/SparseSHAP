# Enhancing KernelSHAP with Stochastic Dimensionality Reduction

## Overview
This repository presents a novel approach aimed at enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models, especially in high-dimensional datasets. By integrating stochastic dimensionality reduction techniques with KernelSHAP, we aim to provide clearer and more reliable explanations of model predictions. Our methodology focuses on super-pixel segmentation and SHAP value averaging, addressing computational challenges and improving the interpretability of complex AI systems.

## Features
- **Stochastic Dimensionality Reduction:** Innovative technique to manage high-dimensional data, making KernelSHAP computations more feasible and efficient.
- **Super-pixel Segmentation:** Utilizes super-pixels to reduce complexity while retaining essential information for interpretation.
- **SHAP Value Averaging:** Enhances the robustness of SHAP explanations by averaging results over multiple stochastic iterations.
